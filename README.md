# Jowo

A personal exercise to learn how Hindley-Milner type inference works in an untyped lambda calculus. This project is written in Purescript and littered with my personal notes as comments. Feel free to give feedback.

## TODO
- [ ] Write the parser
- [ ] Update the test suit with syntaxes rather than ASTs
